# Nexter

Nexter is a simple web layout built with CSS-GRID and SCSS. It is a static application and has no purpose at all. I've built it in order to train and learn new CSS/SCSS content.

## What I have learned

I have learned how to use Flexbox and Grid. Nonetheless, with this project I have learned how to do an effective layout for Desktop and Mobile screens without using a lot o Media Queries.

## Technologies

- SCSS
- CSS ( Flexbox, Grid )
- HTML 3
